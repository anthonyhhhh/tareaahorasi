 spent hours, literally hours trying to do this, when i thought i had fixed something, something went wrong, when i fixed that bug, another one appeared, it was a vicious circle; Even after all the effort i put into it, the page still has many failures, quite notable failures. i liked it, a little, just a little, i plan to fix this page as soon as i learn more about it!

 Got TodoApp looking pretty good on mobile! I can't say the same for the list...it was the hardest for me, and even with the hours I put into it, I did pretty poorly.

I don't think I can say anything more about it, I think the second hardest part of all this was uploading it to github, bro, they should make this page simpler, there are stupid people like me who don't understand it. .

They don't know the user experience.

note: i don't know english, i translated all this from google translate

note 2: no need to worry, I'll start an English course!

Another thing to add is that when trying to open another linked page, for example an app, it says it doesn't exist, I really don't know how to fix it.

what I did is write the name of each folder in the search engine, it's tedious, but it's the only way to make it work aaa

here are the addresses of my page
